Building on the VGG19 framework, we develop SERS-VGG27 - a spectrally adapted network incorporating 1D convolutions with kernel size of 1 that achieves 31.25% parameter reduction while improving classification accuracy. 
Source of the original SERS dataset: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssensors.4c01205

Steps to run code:
1. Run the "Merge datasets.py" file to obtain the cleaned Raman dataset.
2. Run the "SERS_VGG27.py" file.
